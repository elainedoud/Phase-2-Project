Theme Park Project using React
Cesar Hernandez and Elaine Doud created this website using React. It allows users to view a list of U.S. theme parks, as well as to see reviews from attendees. There are multiple interactive components in this project. Our main goal was to create a website that was entertaining for users, while also demonstrating our knowledge and understanding of hooks in React.

Our Database
We created a database (DB JSON file) for our project. It included names, locations, photos, and guest reviews of the amusement parks. All photos and quotes used are for educational purposes only.

Theme Park Photos and Reviews
Brightly colored photos of ten popular theme parks are the focal point of our website. Their city and state is listed as well. Clicking on a photo will trigger it to flip and reveal a review from a real life theme park guest.

Search Bar
The search bar allows theme parks on the website to be easily located. The search bar is not case sensitive, and will bring up the correct result even when lower case letters are used in the search bar.

Park Submit
Our project includes a form so visitors to the website can add an additional theme park. Using POST functionality within React, the information that the user enters will permanently adhere to the DOM once submitted. Information we're requesting is the theme park's name, photo, state, and a review.

Client Side Routing
We have a navigation bar which allows users to navigate to different portions of our website.
